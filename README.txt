1. The hyperparameters are present in config.py.
2. Run train.py to train the model on the train dataset. The default model is ResNeXt50. It can be changed to load a different pre-trained model in the train.py file under the 'Loading the model to run' heading.
3. Run test.py to test the model on the test dataset.

The current logs folder contains logs of all the models trained using different hyperparameters. These logs are generated by the train.py script automatically when run. Feel free to delete existing logs. 
Make sure to change the name of the log file in train.py under "Writing the loss and results' heading and then in log.open
